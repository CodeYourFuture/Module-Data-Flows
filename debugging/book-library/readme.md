# My Book Library

## topics: debugging, DOM

My website should be able to:

- View a list of books that I've read
- Add books to a list of books that I've read
  - Including title, author, number of pages and if I've read it
  - If any of the information is missing it shouldn't add the book and should show an alert
- Remove books from my list

## Bugs to be fixed

1. Website loads but doesn't show any books
line 57 synthax error in render
2. Error in console when you try to add a book
line 41 the original code tried pushing to a wrong array name
3. It uses the title name as the author name
in line 40 title.value was repeated
4. Delete button is broken
line 92 inconsistent name deleteBut
line 97 typo
5. When I add a book that I say I've read - it saves the wrong answer
line 80 no should be first
