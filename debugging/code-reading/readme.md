# Code reading

## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    function f1()
3    {
4        let x = 2;
5        console.log(x);
6    }
7    f1();
8    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 5 and line 8 output different numbers.

Due to x holding different values in global scope and functional scope

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```js
let x = 10;

function f1() {
  console.log(x);
  let y = 20;
}

console.log(f1());
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.

The first console.log will log 10 to the console, while the second will log undefined and throw a reference error due to y only being available in the function 


## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```js
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.

First console.log outputs 9 as x is passed and the f1 call doesn't alter its value outside the fn.
Second console.log prints the object {x:10} as f2 increments y.x by 1
