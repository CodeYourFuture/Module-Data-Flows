## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    function f1()
3    {
4        let x = 2;
5        console.log(x);
6    }
7    f1();
8    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 5 and line 8 output different numbers.
Answer: line 5 output local variable x (2) from the function without returning it and line 8 output global variable x (1) from the main program.

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```js
let x = 10;

function f1() {
  console.log(x);
  let y = 20;
}

console.log(f1());
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
Answer: output will be 10 and undefined because the first log will display global x (10) and the 2nd log will be undefined as y is declared in the function locally but isn't returned globally.

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```js
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
Answer: first part returns 9 as x because f1 creates a copy of x and handles and stores the result but x stays the same. 2nd part returns a modified object y as { x: 10} because f2 modifies the object.
